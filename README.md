# Data Science – Structured Learning Repository

This repository contains my structured, topic-wise learning and hands-on practice in Data Science and AI, implemented primarily using Python and its core data ecosystem.

The focus of this repository is concept clarity, correctness, and practical implementation, not polished production systems.

---

## Repository Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build a strong foundation in Data Science
- Practice concepts through code, notebooks, and experiments
- Maintain a well-organized reference for revision and continuous learning
- Track progress over time rather than present finished projects

This is a learning repository, not a deployment-ready or commercial codebase.

## Important Notes & Limitations

- This repository is not production-ready
- Code quality varies because it reflects learning stages
- Some notebooks may:
  - Lack documentation
  - Contain experimental or redundant code
  - Focus more on understanding than optimization

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.

## Intended Audience

- Beginners learning Data Science fundamentals
- Students revising Python, NumPy, and Pandas
- Recruiters reviewing learning consistency and technical progression
- Self-learners who value concept clarity over shortcuts

---

## Future Improvements

- Add detailed README files inside each folder
- Improve notebook documentation
- Add EDA-focused datasets
- Introduce advanced ML and deep learning sections
